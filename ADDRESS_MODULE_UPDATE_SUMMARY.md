## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Create address with all fields - Should succeed
- [ ] Create address without flatHouseCompany - Should fail
- [ ] Create address with invalid mobile (9 digits) - Should fail
- [ ] Create address with invalid pincode (5 digits) - Should fail
- [ ] Update address with all fields - Should succeed

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Fill checkout address form completely - Should save
- [ ] Try to save without flatHouseCompany - Should show error
- [ ] Enter 9-digit mobile - Should show error
- [ ] Enter 5-digit pincode - Should show error
- [ ] Save address and verify display format
- [ ] Edit saved address - Should load all fields
- [ ] Complete checkout with new address format - Should work
- [ ] Test both Razorpay and COD payments
- [ ] Test address management page
- [ ] Add new address from address management
- [ ] Edit existing address
- [ ] Set default address

---

## API Compatibility

### Address Object Structure (Sent to Backend)
```javascript
{
  name: "John Doe",
  phone: "9876543210",
  pincode: "400001",
  state: "Maharashtra",
  addressLine: "Sector 5, MG Road",
  flatHouseCompany: "Flat 101, Building A",
  city: "Mumbai",
  landmark: "Near City Mall",
  addressType: "Home"
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing `zip` field mapped to `pincode`
- ✅ Old addresses without `flatHouseCompany` will show empty
- ⚠️ **Migration needed**: Existing database addresses need `flatHouseCompany` added

---

## Migration Notes

If you have existing addresses in the database:

1. **Option 1**: Set a default value for `flatHouseCompany`:
```javascript
db.addresses.updateMany(
  { flatHouseCompany: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { flatHouseCompany: "" } }
);
```

2. **Option 2**: Make field temporarily optional, allow users to update:
- Remove `required: true` from model temporarily
- Add banner asking users to update addresses
- Re-enable `required: true` after migration

3. **Recommended**: Combine existing `address` and extract flat/house info if possible
