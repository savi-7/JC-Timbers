## 🎬 What Happens During Tests

1. **Chrome browser opens** (you'll see it)
2. **Tests run automatically**:
   - Browser navigates to different pages
   - Clicks links
   - Fills forms
   - Takes screenshots
3. **Browser closes**
4. **Results show in terminal**
5. **Screenshots saved** to `screenshots/` folder

---

## 📸 Screenshots

After running tests, check the `screenshots/` folder:

```
screenshots/
├── 01-homepage.png        # Your homepage
├── 02-products.png        # Products page
├── 03-navigation.png      # After clicking links
└── 04-contact.png         # Contact form filled
```

---

## 🎯 Run Individual Tests

Don't want to run all 4? Run them separately:

```bash
# Test 1 only
npm run test:homepage

# Test 2 only
npm run test:products

# Test 3 only
npm run test:navigation

# Test 4 only
npm run test:contact
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Change URL
Edit the test files and change:
```javascript
await driver.get('http://localhost:5173');
```

### Run Without Opening Browser (Headless)
Uncomment this line in any test file:
```javascript
options.addArguments('--headless');
```

### Add More Wait Time
If your pages load slowly:
```javascript
await driver.sleep(2000); // Change to 3000 or 5000
```

2. **Easy to Run**: Just `npm test`
3. **Visual**: You see the browser open and tests run
4. **Screenshots**: Automatic proof of tests
5. **Clear Output**: Easy-to-read test results
6. **No Configuration**: Works out of the box
7. **Individual Tests**: Run one test at a time if needed
8. **Error Handling**: Takes screenshots on errors

---

## 🛠️ What's Installed

Running `npm install` will install:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **selenium-webdriver** | Main Selenium library for Node.js |
| **chromedriver** | Chrome browser driver for Selenium |

---

## 💡 Tips

### For Best Results:
- ✅ Make sure Chrome browser is installed
- ✅ Make sure your app is running on `localhost:5173`
- ✅ Close other Chrome instances before running tests
- ✅ Check screenshots after tests to see visual proof

### Speed Up Tests:
- Enable headless mode (browser doesn't open)
- Reduce sleep/wait times in test files
- Run individual tests instead of all 4

### Debugging:
- Screenshots are saved automatically on errors
- Check terminal output for detailed error messages
- Run tests individually to isolate issues

## 🎓 Learning Selenium

These tests are simple and well-commented. You can:
- **Read the test files** to learn Selenium syntax
- **Modify tests** to add more checks
- **Copy tests** to create new ones
- **Use as templates** for your own tests

### Common Selenium Commands Used:

```javascript
// Navigate to URL
await driver.get('http://localhost:5173');

// Find element
const element = await driver.findElement(By.css('.className'));

// Find multiple elements
const elements = await driver.findElements(By.css('.className'));

// Click element
await element.click();

// Type in input
await element.sendKeys('text');

// Get page title
const title = await driver.getTitle();

// Get current URL
const url = await driver.getCurrentUrl();

// Take screenshot
await driver.takeScreenshot();

// Wait
await driver.sleep(2000);
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `cd client/tests/selenium && npm install`
2. **Start your app**: `cd client && npm run dev`
3. **Run tests**: `cd tests/selenium && npm test`
4. **Check screenshots**: Open `screenshots/` folder
5. **Read README.md**: For detailed documentation

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'selenium-webdriver'"
```bash
cd client/tests/selenium
npm install
```

### "Connection refused to localhost:5173"
Start your app:
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### "ChromeDriver version mismatch"
Update ChromeDriver:
```bash
npm install chromedriver@latest
```

### Tests fail
1. Check if app is running on `localhost:5173`
2. Check screenshots in `screenshots/` folder
3. Read error messages in terminal
4. Run individual tests to isolate issue
